# 🙏 IntoTheHeaven

> A platform for managing prayer topics and life sharing in church small groups.

---

## 📚 Philosophy

> _"A record of community's walk with God."_

- What have we prayed for as a group?
- What themes keep reappearing?
- How has God answered over time?

This is not just a utility — it's a **spiritual reflection tool**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

**IntoTheHeaven** exists to help small groups in churches record, organize, and reflect on what was shared and prayed in each meeting.

Unlike sermon-based journaling tools, this platform focuses on **group-centered spiritual history**.

## 🔐 API Logic

### Token Refresh Flow

1.  Upon successful login, the server issues an `accessToken` only.
2.  When the `accessToken` expires, the user is asked to re-login by being redirected to the login page.

## 🧪 Testing

- Unit and integration tests will focus on the core domain logic.
